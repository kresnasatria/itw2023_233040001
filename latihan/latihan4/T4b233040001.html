        <h2>The Most Expensive Helmet</h2>

        <p class="penulis2">When it comes to motorcycle protection, AGV helmets are considered to be up there with the best of them. Their lids protect the heads of many of the world’s leading racers, with both <a class="link1" href="https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentino_Rossi">Valentino Rossi</a> and <a class="link2" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Martin">Guy Martin</a> sporting protective headgear from the iconic Italian brand. AGV has been renowned for its innovation throughout its evolving range of helmets. So, we thought we’d bring together a selection of some of the best helmets currently available from AGV.</p>
        <div class="via"></div>

        <p class="penulis2">Although AGV also makes open-face helmets for urban riding, our picks are all full-face road and sports helmets that you could use on the street or track – be it the occasional track day or in some cases, proper racing. As with many helmets, the AGV models below are aerodynamically shaped and are wind tunnel-tested. They are all Pinlock insert-ready for fog-free riding and most feature AGV’s integrated ventilation system. There are several steps to AGV’s development testing of its helmets: durability, material, visual, paint resistance, and wind tunnel tests. Then having manufactured its helmet, AGV puts it through component testing too, for things like the visor and strap. Some AGV helmets also have compatible integrated <a class="link3" href="https://www.motorcyclenews.com/bike-kit/communication/best-motorbike-intercoms/">Intercom systems</a> that can be easily and subtly fitted so you can connect your phone or all sorts of other devices.</p>

        <p class="penulis2">Okay, so the <a class="link4" href="https://www.agv.com/us/en/full-face/pista-gp-rr/">Pista GP-RR</a> is probably as much as you're ever going to spend on a lid. What you get for your money though is the créme de la créme of motorcycle helmets, with the very best technology currently available. It's constructed with an outer carbon fibre shell and has been developed at the very top level of motorcycle racing. It's also been aerodynamically designed to be comfortable and stable at high speed, helped by the addition of a large and wind-tunnel tested Biplano rear spoiler.</p>

        <p class="penulis2">A more budget-oriented price doesn't mean the <a class="link6" href="https://www.agv.com/us/en/full-face/k-3-sv/">K-3 SV</a> scrimps on quality. It comes loaded with handy features that make this a great helmet for the price. It's also ready to take the AGV Share Bluetooth system and is also Pinlock-ready. The helmet is constructed from a thermoplastic resin shell which comes in two sizes. The K-3 SV also features an internal sun visor and a fully removable Dri-Lex microfiber lining.</p>
